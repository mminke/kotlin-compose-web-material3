State: WIP / ALPHA!!!!!

This project aims to implement the __Material3 Web Components__ for __Kotlin Compose Web__.

The Material3 Web Components are currently being developed and are still in alpha stage. Therefor this project is nowhere near stable as this project depends on the development of those web components.

## Structure

There are two parts, the library which contains the components and which can be used in your own projects and an example directory which is created to have a project showcasing the components from the library.

## Alternative

If you are looking for a much more mature library for material design (as far as I can see material design 2), please have a look at:
